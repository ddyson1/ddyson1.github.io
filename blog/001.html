    <h4>some recent thoughts</h4>
    <p> why is it called fiat currency?
      <br> the latin word 'fiat' translates to 'a determination by authority'
      <br> it's the government that decrees the value of the currency and isn't representivtive
      <br> of another asset or financial instrument such as gold or a check
      <br> so what is the takeaway?
      <br> centrality is where the power lies
      <br> what if this power were to be decentralized?
